I am a scientific researcher and head of the Automated Software Testing (AST) Field of Competence at [fortiss](https://www.fortiss.org/en/) and 
an Assistant Professor at the Chair of Software Engineering for Data-intensive Applications of the School of Computation, Information and Technology of the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/).

My research focuses on the interface between software engineering and deep learning with the goals of improving the robustness, reliability, and dependability of data-intensive software systems. 

Current interests involve monitoring techniques and automated functional oracles for deep learning-based systems, with a particular focus on autonomous vehicles, and the robustness and maintainability of test suites of modern web applications.
